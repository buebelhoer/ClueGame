We choose to test all the doors, rather than just a few, because it was minimally more work, and ensures complete functionality. Rooms were checked at random, just ensuring that the first room, last room, and walkway were all checked. Cells to check were chosen based on anticipated problem points, such as cell labels, edges of the board, and secret passages. We chose to use the same basic tests as the example, because it encompassed all potential problem points.
